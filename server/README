This is a minimal database setup, without any provisions for user
authentication or authorization--anyone using the api can view or change
records. We've given the payroll admin user an easily-guessed password and
included the database config in the source. You'll want to use your own config
and include a separate .env file which is not captured in source control.

Mysql setup:

  # Set up the database and user rights. You'll need your Mysql root password for this:
  mysql -u root -p < admin.sql

  # Create the tables and data:
  mysql -u payroll_admin -p < create.sql
